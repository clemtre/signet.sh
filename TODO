- make a makefile in order to variabilize language in add.sh prompt and
  make overall config easier
- pin links
- search select tags for filtering
- a better way to capture url 
    → something that grabs current page to clipboard
- hardcode bookmark ids in awk rather than css so that ids are
  persistant and don't slide if a link is removed
    → add.sh id++
- make other ways to edit and generate bookmarks if dmenu is too much of
  a struggle to install.
