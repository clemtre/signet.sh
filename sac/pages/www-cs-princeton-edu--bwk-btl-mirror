<h3> Bell Labs pages from long ago </h3>

<P> This page mirrors some of the information 
that used to be on my Bell Labs site.
Much of it is very dusty indeed.
Caveat downloader.

<P> <li>Awk is now hosted at
 <a href="https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk">Github</a>.

<li><a href="partitioning.pdf">An Efficient Heuristic Procedure for Partitioning Graphs</a> 
(<i>Bell System Technical Journal</i>, February, 1970).

<li><a href="tsp.pdf">An Effective Heuristic
Algorithm for the Travelling-Salesman Problem</a> 
(<i>OperationscResearch</i>, March, 1973).

<li>
<a HREF="notfavorite.html">Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language</a> (April, 1981).

<li>
<a HREF="/cm/cs/who/bwk/wise/index.html">WiSE - A Wireless System Engineering Tool</A>, 
an application of computational geometry, optimization
and visualization to wireless.

<li><a HREF="tcltk95.workshop.pdf">Experience with Tcl/Tk for Scientific and Engineering Visualization</A>,
programming issues in the wireless work above;
a version appeared in the Tcl/Tk Workshop, Toronto, 1995.

<li>
<a HREF="interps/interpreters.pdf">Timing Trials, or, the Trials of Timing:
Experiments with Scripting and User-Interface Languages</A>,
with Chris Van Wyk, describes experiments to see how fast various scripting
and user interface languages,
from Awk to Visual Basic, run on a spectrum of representative tasks.

<li><a href="awkc++.pdf">An AWK to C++ Translator</a>,
describing an early experiment; published in the
Usenix C++ conference in 1991 but hard to find.

<li>Information about the
<a HREF=https://www.ampl.com/ampl>AMPL modeling language</A>
for mathematical optimization.

You can <a href="https://www.ampl.com/TRYAMPL">try AMPL</a> on your own
optimization problems or examples from
 <a HREF="https://www.ampl.com/BOOK">the AMPL book</A>;
the second edition was published November 2002 and is now available for
free download.

<li>Examples from <em>The AWK Programming Language</em> by Aho,
Kernighan, and Weinberger <a HREF="awkcode.txt">as text (120KB)</a>
or <a HREF="awkcode.zip">zipped (30KB)</a>.

<li>The example code from <em>The Unix Programming Environment</em>
by Kernighan and Pike:
 <a HREF="unixprogenv.tar.gz"> gzipped tar file</a>;
 <a href="unixprogenv.zip"> zip file</a>.

<li>Source for
 <a HREF="hoc.sh">the hoc calculator from <em>The Unix Programming Environment</em></a>
by Kernighan and Pike.

<li><a href="toolstape"><i>Software Tools</i> programs</a>

<li><a href="pascaltools.txt"><i>Software Tools in Pascal</i> programs</a>

<li>Source for <a HREF="learn.tar.gz">learn</a>, 
the original Unix computer-aided instruction program.  This works but is
mostly of historical interest; it dates from 1979.

<li> <a HREF="anim.cstr132.pdf">Algorithm animation</a> (with Jon Bentley).
