<h1>Eric Allman</h1><br><br>
eric(A/T)neophilic(D/O/T)com
<br style="clear: left;">
<p>I am the author of
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail">sendmail</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog">syslog</a>,
tset,
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_%28text_game%29#Other_versions">trek</a>,
and several other programs. &nbsp;I was co-founder of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sendmail.com/">Sendmail, Inc.</a>
I am author of a few
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</a>
RFCs.
I started my career on the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres_%28database%29">
INGRES Relational Database Management System Project</a>
while a student at Berkeley, becoming the Lead Programmer there.
I then moved to
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britton_Lee,_Inc.">Britton Lee</a>
doing interfaces for one of the first database servers
(which we called "database machines"
because the name "client/server" hadn't become popular yet).
I've also worked at
<a target="_blank" href="http://icsi.berkeley.edu">The International Computer Science Institute</a>
on the Ring Array Processor Project for neural-net-based speech recognition
and
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sqlstream.com/">SQLstream</a>
doing streaming data analytics.
I was co-founder (with
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=466601">Greg Olson</a>)
of <a href="http:www.sendmail.com">Sendmail, Inc.</a>, one of the first
"hybrid open source/commercial" companies.
My latest gig is at the
<a target="_blank" href="http://swarmlab.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Swarm Lab</a>
at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">U.C. Berkeley</a>
working on the
<a target="_blank" href="https://gdp.eecs.berkeley.edu">Global Data Plane</a>,
a data storage and transmission layer emphasizing security and scalability
focusing on edge computing including
large swarms of sensors and actuators
(sometimes called the Internet of Things).
</p>
<p>I'm a founding member of the Editorial Review Board of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.acmqueue.org/">ACM Queue</a>
magazine.
I'm on the board of the
<a href="http://www.hillsideclub.org/">Hillside Club</a>.
Previously, I was Vice President and Treasurer of
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX
Association</a>.
a member of the <a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a> Council,
and on the Board of Trustees for
<a href="http://calperfs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cal Performances</a>
(but thankfully not all at once).
</p>
<p>
I am co-author of the <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> book <i>Sendmail</i>.
I've also written a chapter for
<em><a href="http://www.aosabook.org">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a></em>,
and have authored many papers, articles, and columns,
some of which are
<a href="http://www.neophilic.com/~eric/Talks/index.html">referenced above</a>.

</p>
<p>
I was happily semi-retired for a while,
but then (to my surprise) decided I wanted more social contact.
After spending a career wishing that people would just go away
and leave you alone so you could get some work done,
it's quite a shock when they actually do it,
and not nearly as pleasant as you might think.
</p>
<p>
During my semi-retirement I did manage to get re-engaged with hardware,
playing with Arduino and other toys.

I'm documenting those projects on my
<a href="/blogs/eric.php">blog</a>
as I have time to do so.
-->
I had been documenting those projects on my blog,
but my blog software didn't survive my last system upgrade,
so I'm trying to find a Plan B.
</p>
<p>
I'm the brother of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Allman">Cat Allman</a>
and the husband of
<a href="https://www.mckusick.com">Kirk McKusick</a>.
