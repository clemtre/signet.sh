<p>
This site is a collection of free and open-source man pages. Its
purpose is to provide convenient and stable access to man page content.
For example, it has man pages for several distributions, it has permalinks,
it interlinks man pages in various ways and allows linking into
a specific line or section of a man page.

    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <p>
    Selected features of this site:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Permalinks - each man page shows a permalink which is a stable
            reference to its content. This is useful when citing a man page
            or parts of it. Stable means that you get the exact same content
        even if newer versions of that man page source are imported, either
        when a new distribution version is added or when an updated package
    (that provides the man page) is added.
        </li>
        <li>Short links - short links are easy to construct and
            thus can be used for direct access to a man page. For example, to access the <code>strcopy()</code> man page in Fedora 29: <a href="/f29/3/strcpy">/f29/3/strcpy</a> &mdash; or to access the <code>open</code> man page in the highest prioritized section: <a href="/f29/open">/f29/open</a>
        </li>
        <li>Overview pages - there are pages that list all the section of a
            distribution or all the pages inside a section, such as
            <a href="/f29/3">/f29/3</a>
            (all pages in Section 3 in Fedora 29) and <a href="/29">/f29</a>
            (all sections in Fedora 29). This allows for better indexing and
            quick in-browser searches.
        </li>
        <li>Inter-section links - for some names there are man pages in
            multiple sections. Since sometimes it's easy to end up in the wrong
            section or to be surprised that there are other man pages of the
            same name in other sections the navigation column contains links to
            man pages of the same name in other sections.
        </li>
        <li>Inter-distribution links - there also links between man pages of
            the same name in other distributions. This might be convenient to
            quickly check the availability of an API in another system or
            distribution version.
        </li>
        <li>Reverse-links - i.e. what links here
        </li>
        <li>Responsive layout - the HTML pages use CSS Flexible Box layout
            such that the man pages are decently viewable on different
            screen sizes, e.g. also on smartphones.
        </li>
        <li>No JavaScript - omitting JavaScript helps with load times
            and saves some cycles on the client side. Some frontend
            frameworks come with some good design defaults, an easy
            to use grid and responsive design but add some hundred
            kilobytes including some JavaScript. The JavaScript might
            be there for some extra features or to implement
            responsive layout in legacy browsers. Thus, there are
            basically only downsides on using JavaScript in a site
            like this.

    The site's content is stored in a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a> database. The loader
    that imports man pages into the database is written in Python,
    using <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/">SQLAlchemy Core expressions</a> for database operations.
    The actual site software is written in Go, using just the
    <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq">pq Postgres driver</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/gziphandler">gziphandler</a> package as
    non-standard dependencies. That means the Go code implements a
    HTTP server (using <code>net/http</code>) that implements
    a URL multiplexer, selects from the database and executes
    some nested Go <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">HTML templates</a>.
    The Go server is put behind an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">NGINX</a> reverse proxy such
    that
    popular pages are served from a cache and to allow for seamless updates.

    There are many browsable man page repositories available. The following
    details some of the differences of the more popular ones with this site.
    </p>
    <p>
    All of the compared sites are missing some semi-advanced features like
    permalinks, inter-section links, inter-distribution links, reverse-links,
    linkable sections and line-numbers in man pages.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Debian project runs <a
        href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> that
    provides access to the man pages of some Debian releases. As of
    2019-04-30, most pages have inter-system links to Debian stretch, Debian testing,
    stretch-backports and Debian unstable. It's unclear how stable these links are.
    That means whether the links to stretch will still work after the next stable
    Debian is released. There are no permalinks to pages of a distribution
    version - e.g. a page in stretch or unstable might be replaced by an
        package update at any time. On the positive side, there are
        inter-section links, including links to translated pages.
    </p>
    <p>
    The FreeBSD project has a <a
        href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi">Web form</a> for querying
    the man pages of various UNIX/Linux distributions. Since there aren't any
    overview pages the pages aren't indexed by web search engines like
    Google. The produced links are long query strings, thus not user
    friendly for writing them from scratch. There are no inter-distribution links for
    easily switching between man page versions.
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/">Man7.org</a> serves the man
    pages from the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/">Linux
    man-pages project</a> and a few other projects. It probably closely
    follows the master branch of the man-pages project. Or it contains the HTML
    renderings of the latest release. In any case, links into this repository
    aren't stable because you just get some current version. It's also unclear
    how often the other projects are updated.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://man.cx/">Man.cx</a> tracks almost all man-pages of
    Debian testing. In contrast to many other services, it includes the date
    of the import run. Similar to other services, the links aren't stable,
    one can only reference the current version. On the plus side, it
    provides inter-section links.
    </p>
    <p><a href="http://man.he.net/">Hurrican Electric</a> also provides a man
    page repository besides its many other awesome free network related
    services (related to IPv6, DNS etc.). The HTML rendering of the man
    pages is very basic, e.g. bold/underscore markup is gone, sections
    aren't rendered as headings, and URLs aren't rendered as link.
    Parameters are encoded as query strings, but there are some overview
    pages such that a robot has a chance indexing the pages. It's completely
    opaque from which system the pages are imported from. As of 2019-04-30,
    it looks like the pages weren't updated in the last 6 years. The man
    pages are likely from a Linux distribution that was released in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/">die.net</a> also has a
    Linux man page repository. There isn't any information on
    how often these man pages are updated, from which Linux system
    they are imported from and who is behind this service ('a few dozen
    friends in the US'). The links aren't stable, but the pages are
    indexed well by Google.
