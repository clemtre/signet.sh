unsorted list of things that would be nice to have

* *make a make*file in order to variabilize language in add.sh prompts
  and make overall config easier
* pin links
    → add an optional boolean to the records implictly false if absent.
    if true, the link sits on top of the pile
* search select tags for filtering
    → tags inside \<nav> would be \<button>s instead of \<p>s and filter
    the links accordingly 
* a better way to capture url 
    → something that grabs current page to clipboard
* hardcode bookmark ids in awk rather than css so that ids are
  persistant and don't slide if a link is removed
    → add.sh id++
* make other ways to edit and generate bookmarks if dmenu is too much of
  a struggle to install.
* plug other pages / tools to it - ie : 
  * unicode dictionnary, css colors
  * notes (report, files recently written)
  * agenda ← big textual dreams about this one
  * weather forecast -- in the form of a line in the bookmarks maybe ?? 
  * documentations, html/css properties quickref
  * images, something like signet.sh but for images and their metadata.
    entries from an IMAGES file database would be attached to downloaded
    images, the most recent ones cascading in a line as thumbnails
    somewhere alongside links...
